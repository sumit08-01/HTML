Canvas	                                                                SVG
Resolution dependent
No support for event handlers
Poor text rendering capabilities
You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
Well suited for graphic-intensive games

                                                                    Support for event handlers
                                                                    Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)
                                                                    Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow)
                                                                    Not suited for game applications
