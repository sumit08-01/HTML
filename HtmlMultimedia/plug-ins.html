            Plug-ins
            Plug-ins were designed to be used for many different purposes:

            To run Java applets
            To run Microsoft ActiveX controls
            To display Flash movies
            To display maps
            To scan for viruses
            To verify a bank id

              The <object> Element
                  The <object> element is supported by all browsers.
                      
                      The <object> element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.
                          
                          It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can also be used to include HTML in HTML:
                        
            </section>
        </div>
        <div>
            <object width="100%" height="500px" data="Video.html"></object>
            <object data="/car.jpeg"></object>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>The <embed>embed Element
                The <embed>embed element is supported in all major browsers.
                The <embed>embed element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document.
                Web browsers have supported the <embed>embed element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML specification before HTML5.
            </h3>

            <embed src="/car.jpeg">

                <h5>Note that the <embed>embed element does not have a closing tag. It can not contain alternative text.

                The <embed>embed element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:</h5>
                    <embed width="100%" height="500px" src="Video.html">
